# Electrical-Hardware Documentation
Electrical hardware development consists of choosing the sensors, computing device(s), battery, and other electronics.  It involves researching how the components operate and getting them to work together.  The electrical hardware is what links the mechanics and the software of the robot.  Right now, we are planning on using a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as our single board computer to control the robot.
