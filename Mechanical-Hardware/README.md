# Mechanical Documentation
Mechanical development involves designing and manufacturing the mechanical system of the robot.  This includes everything from the mobility system and framework to the mechanism that collects the cubes.  We have many tools to our disposal from physical tools and 3D printers in our lab, to the free student edition of the professional design tool, SolidWorks.
